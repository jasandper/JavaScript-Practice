>This is how you do quotes in markdown, it's  a pretty interesting process but, but it doesn't look like you need to have multiple special charactesr for each line, only one to star out the quote.

Try using an html tag like `<h1>` and maybe `<button>` or maybe a several line of code display like

```javascript
function snacks(a, b=10) {
    if(a > b) {
        console.log('a is greater than b')
    }
}
```
